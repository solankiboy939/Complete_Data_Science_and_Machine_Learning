## Introduction

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. This project covers a wide range of machine learning topics, including:

- **Supervised Learning:** Algorithms that learn from labeled data. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Algorithms that infer patterns from unlabeled data. Examples include clustering algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Algorithms that learn by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Examples include Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning.
- **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning involving neural networks with many layers. Examples include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence prediction.

The goal of this repository is to provide an educational resource that helps individuals understand the theory behind machine learning algorithms and how to implement them in practice using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Complete_Science_-_Machine_Learning.git
    cd Complete_Science_-_Machine_Learning
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate different machine learning algorithms and techniques. You can start by exploring the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.

1. **Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd notebooks
    ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Open any notebook to see the code and visualizations.**
    For example, open `01_linear_regression.ipynb` to see how linear regression is implemented from scratch and using scikit-learn.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what you can find in this repository:

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable. Below is a snippet of code for linear regression using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([1, 3, 2, 3, 5])

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue')
plt.plot(X, predictions, color='red')
plt.title('Linear Regression Example')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
