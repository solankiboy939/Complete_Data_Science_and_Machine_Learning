# Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy

Welcome to the **Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy** repository! This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of two of the most essential Python libraries for data analysis: **Pandas** and **NumPy**. Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a researcher, or just curious about data manipulation and analysis, this repository will guide you through practical examples and powerful techniques.

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

- **Pandas**: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames and Series to handle structured data seamlessly.
- **NumPy**: A foundational package for numerical computing in Python, offering support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## ðŸ“š Features

- **Data Manipulation**: Learn how to clean, filter, and transform your data using Pandas.
- **Numerical Computation**: Perform advanced mathematical operations with NumPy arrays.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrate with libraries like Matplotlib to visualize data trends.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of the directory structure:

```
data_analysis/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sample_data.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_cleaning.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ numerical_analysis.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_visualization.py
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

- `data/`: Contains sample datasets for practice.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for various data analysis tasks.
- `README.md`: This file with project details and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.

## ðŸ“‹ Usage

### Data Cleaning with Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

# Clean data by removing missing values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

# Save cleaned data
df_cleaned.to_csv('data/cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
```

### Numerical Analysis with NumPy

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform basic operations
mean_value = np.mean(data)
std_dev = np.std(data)

print(f"Mean: {mean_value}, Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
```

### Data Visualization (Example)

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and plot data
df = pd.read_csv('data/cleaned_data.csv')
df['column_name'].plot(kind='hist')
plt.title('Histogram of column_name')
plt.show()
```
